# **App Name**: Fleaxova Manager

## Core Features:

- Project Creation: Create a new project with specified folder structure, including client (React + Vite) and server (Express.js) directories.
- Dependency Installation: Install dependencies to client and server based on a predefined blueprint (e.g., React, Vite, Express.js, CORS).
- Folder Structure Setup: Automatically create the required folder structure in both client (src, components, pages, services, context) and server (src, config, controllers, middleware, routes).
- .env File Setup: Generate basic .env files in both client and server directories with placeholder variables.
- Server Initialization: Create a basic server.js file with CORS setup and placeholder for routes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A modern blue (#2E9AFE) to represent structure and efficiency.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) to provide a clean and neutral canvas.
- Accent color: A vibrant purple (#BE52F2) for highlighting key actions and elements, ensuring they stand out against the blue and gray.
- Font: 'Inter' for both headings and body text. Its clean, modern sans-serif style provides excellent readability and a professional feel, fitting for project management.
- Clean, modular layout with clear divisions between sections.
- Use simple, professional icons from a set like 'Material Icons' to represent different file types, actions, and statuses.
